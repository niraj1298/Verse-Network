# VerseNetwork Top-Level Design

Welcome to a good overview of the architecture developed for VerseNetwork Forum.

# Front-End
-   **Technology**: ReactJS, TailwindCSS
-   **Design Pattern**: Event-Driven Architecture
-   **Key Aspects**:
    -   **ReactJS**: Utilization of state management and hooks for dynamic and responsive UI.
    -   **TailwindCSS**: For styling and responsive design.


# Back-End

-   **Technology**: NodeJS, ExpressJS
-   **Design Pattern**: Model-View-Controller (MVC)
-   **Key Aspects**:
    -   **NodeJS/ExpressJS**: Building a robust and scalable server-side application.
    -   **RESTful Services**: Implementing RESTful APIs for efficient data handling.
    -   **Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
    
# Database

-   **Technology**: MongoDB
-   **Characteristics**: NoSQL, flexibility, scalability.


# Communication Between Front-End and Back-End

**The front-end and back-end of VerseNetwork interact through a RESTful API interface. Here's a basic overview of how this works**:
- **User Interface Interactions**: When a user interacts with the ReactJS front-end, such as clicking on a specific topic, the front-end makes an API request to the back-end.
- **API Requests**: These requests are handled by NodeJS/ExpressJS on the server-side. The request could be for fetching, posting, updating, or deleting data.
- **Data Retrieval and Management**: The back-end interacts with the MongoDB database to retrieve or manipulate the relevant data. For example, retrieving a list of posts associated with the selected topic.
- **Response to Front-End**: The server then sends a response back to the front-end. This could be the requested data, a confirmation of an action, or an error message.
- **Displaying Data on UI**: The front-end takes this response and updates the UI accordingly. For instance, displaying the list of posts for the selected topic.
- **State Management**: ReactJS manages the state of the application, ensuring that the UI is always in sync with the current application state, based on the responses from the back-end.
